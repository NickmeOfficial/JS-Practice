// ** Parentheses () - Grouping and invoking. **

    //Grouping Expressions: Used to group expressions and alter the order of evaluation.
    
      const result = (2 + 3) * 5; // result will be 25.
    
    // Function invocation: Used to invoke a function and pass arguement.
    
      function greet(name) {
          console.log("hello, " + name + "!");
      }

// ** Braces {} - Code block and object **

    // Code blocks: Used to define a block of code, such as in control flow statement (if, for, while).

       if (condition) {
        // code to be executed if the condition is true.
       }
      
    // Object literals: Used to define an object and its properties.

// ** Brackets [] - Arrays and Property Access **

    // Arrays: Used to define arrays, which are orderlist of value.

      const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8];

    //Property Access: Used to access properties of an object using their keys.

      const user = {
          name: "Nikhil",
          age: 22
      };
  
      console.log(user["name"]); // Accessing the 'name' Property.

// ** Single quotes`' '` and Double quotes `""` **

    // String representation: Used to define strings, and you can use either single or double quotes interchagebly.

      const singleQuoted = 'This is a string';
      const doubleQuoted = "this is also a string";
    
    // Mixing Quotes: Useful when you need to include quotes within a string.

      const MixedQuotes = 'he said, "Hello!"';

// ** Colons- object properties and ternary operator **

    // Object Properties: Used to separate keys and values in object literals.
